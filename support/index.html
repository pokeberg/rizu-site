        <details>
          <summary>What is Rizu?</summary>
          <p>Rizu is a gentle app that invites you to do one small, feel-good thing a day. No pressure, no overwhelm — just tiny actions that make everyday life a little lighter.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What kind of tasks does Rizu suggest?</summary>
          <p>Simple, human things — like stretching for a minute, calling someone you care about, or taking a pause to breathe. Nothing complicated. Nothing time-consuming.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Do I have to use Rizu every day?</summary>
          <p>Not at all. Miss a day, a week, or more — Rizu will still be there whenever you feel like coming back.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What about streaks?</summary>
          <p>Rizu tracks how many times you complete a task, but your streak never breaks. There’s no guilt, no “starting over,” and no punishment for taking a break.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Is Rizu about productivity?</summary>
          <p>No. Rizu isn’t about doing more — it’s about doing something small that feels good.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Do you collect personal data?</summary>
          <p>No personal data is collected or sold. Your experience is private and respectful by design.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Who is Rizu for?</summary>
          <p>Rizu is for anyone who wants to slow down, feel a little better, and be kinder to themselves — especially on busy or low-energy days.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What is “Grace”?</summary>
          <p>Grace is a gentle reset. Sometimes a task just doesn’t fit your day — and that’s okay. Grace lets you shuffle Rizu and get a new task instead. You earn one Grace for every three tasks you complete.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How do I use Grace?</summary>
          <p>When Grace is available, you can use it to shuffle and receive a different task for the day. No penalties. No pressure. Just a small way to meet your day where it is.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Why the name “Rizu”?</summary>
          <p>Rizu is a soft, invented name inspired by flow, rhythm, and gentle movement. It doesn’t mean one specific thing — and that’s intentional. Like the app itself, Rizu is shaped by small moments, not strict definitions.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Is Rizu free?</summary>
          <p>Yes. Rizu is free to download and use.</p>
